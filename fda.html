          The openFDA food enforcement reports API returns data from the FDA Recall Enterprise System (RES), a database that contains information on recall event information submitted to FDA.

        <p>When an FDA-regulated product is either defective or potentially harmful, recalling that product or removing it from the market or correcting the problem or is the most effective means for protecting the public.</p>

  <h1>First Alert</h1>

      <p> FDA first hears about a problem product in several ways:
			<ol> 
			 <li> A company discovers a problem and contacts FDA. </li><br>
             <li> FDA inspects a manufacturing facility and determines the potential for a recall.</li>
             <li> FDA receives reports of health problems through various reporting systems.</li>
             <li> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contacts FDA.</li></ol></p>

        <h2 id="hdcol"> Alerting the Public </h2>
        <p> FDA seeks publicity about a recall only when it believes the public needs to be alerted to a serious hazard. When a recalled product has been widely distributed, the news media is a very effective way to reach large numbers of people. FDA can hold press conferences, issue press releases, and post updates to its Web site regularly, to alert people.</p>

        <h2 id="hdcol"> Effectiveness Checks </h2>
        <p> FDA evaluates whether all reasonable efforts have been made to remove or correct a product. A recall is considered complete after all of the company's corrective actions are reviewed by FDA and deemed appropriate. After a recall is completed, FDA makes sure that the product is destroyed or suitably reconditioned, and investigates why the product was defective in the first place.</p>

        <h2 id="hdcol"> Recall Classifications </h2>

        <ol> <li> Class I: Dangerous or defective products that predictably could cause serious health problems or death. Examples include: food found to contain botulinum toxin, food with undeclared allergens, a label mix-up on a lifesaving drug, or a defective artificial heart valve.</li>
             <li>Class II: Products that might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature. Example: a drug that is under-strength but that is not used to treat life-threatening situations.</li>
        <li>Class III: Products that are unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violate FDA labeling or manufacturing laws. Examples include: a minor container defect and lack of English labeling in a retail food.</li></ol>
